			    <p class="style6">Play is an open source web application framework, written in Scala,which follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It aims to optimize developer productivity by using convention over configuration, hot code reloading and display of errors in the browser. Support for the Scala programming language has been available since version 1.1 of the framework. In version 2.0, the framework core was rewritten in Scala. Build and deployment was migrated to SBT, and templates use Scala instead of Groovy. Major differences from Java frameworks are Play 2 is fully RESTful i.e there is no Java EE session per connection, Unit and Selenium support is included in the core and also like Ruby on Rails and Django, Play comes with the concept of modules. The main advantage of using play framework is that it’s a very well designed full-stack framework, so you get a lot of functionality out of the box that work seamlessly. As mentioned above Play combines high productivity of RAD (Rapid application development) frameworks like Rails or Django with performance of JVM.			</p>

	          <p class="style12">Scala, short for Scalable Language, is a hybrid functional programming language. It was created by Martin Odersky. Scala smoothly integrates the features of object-oriented and functional languages. Scala is compiled to run on the Java Virtual Machine. Many existing companies, who depend on Java for business critical applications, are turning to Scala to boost their development productivity, applications scalability and overall reliability.</p>

	          <pre class="style12">List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();  
list.add("1");  
list.add("2");

Scala is essentially the C++ of high level (ergo, memory managed) languages on the JVM.
It supports many paradigms equally, and due to this, it has sacrificed the &quot;simplicity&quot; of the language.
Even though a lot of scala proponents argue that the language is simple due to having less keywords, 
this is somewhat misleading, as its the combination of varying programming paradigms which causes Scala to 
be quite a complex language.</pre>
